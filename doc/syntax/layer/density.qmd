title: "Density"
---

> Layers are declared with the [`DRAW` clause](../clause/draw.qmd). Read the documentation for this clause for a thorough description of how to use it.

Visualise the distribution of a single continuous variable by computing a kernel density estimate. It has a similar interpretation as a histogram but smoothing out observations rather than binning them.

## Aesthetics
The following aesthetics are recognised by the density layer.

### Required
* `x`: Position on the x-axis.

### Optional
* `stroke`: The colour of the contour lines.
* `fill`: The colour of the inner area.
* `colour`: Shorthand for setting `stroke` and `fill` simultaneously.
* `opacity`: The opacity of the colours.
* `linewidth`: The width of the contour lines.

## Settings
* `stacking`: Determines how multiple groups are displayed. One of the following:
    * `'off'`: The groups `y`-values are displayed as-is (default).
    * `'on'`: The `y`-values are stacked per `x` position, accumulating over groups.
    * `'fill'`: Like `'on'` but displayed as a fraction of the total per `x` position.
* `bandwidth`: A numerical value setting the smoothing bandwidth to use. If absent (default), the bandwidth will be computed using Silverman's rule of thumb.
* `adjust`: A numerical value as multiplier for the `bandwidth` setting, with 1 as default.
* `kernel`: Determines the smoothing kernel shape. Can be one of the following:
    * `'gaussian'` (default)
    * `'epanechnikov'`
    * `'triangular'`
    * `'rectangular'` or `'uniform'`
    * `'biweight'` or `'quartic'`
    * `'cosine'`

## Data transformation
The density layer will compute a 1-dimensional grid using the range of the data. The distances between the grid locations and observations are computed and serve as input for a kernel function. The contributions of each observation is then averaged across the grid.

### Properties

* `weight`: If mapped, it sets the relative contribution of an observation to the density estimate.

### Calculated statistics

* `density`: The estimated probability density per point on the grid. The total area of a single density curve adds up to 1.

### Default remappings

* `density AS y`: By default the density layer will display the computed density along the y-axis.

## Examples

A typical KDE computation with different groups:

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE bill_dep AS x, species AS colour FROM ggsql:penguins
  DRAW density SETTING opacity => 0.8
```

Changing the relative bandwidth through the `adjust` setting.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE bill_dep AS x, species AS colour FROM ggsql:penguins
  DRAW density SETTING opacity => 0.8, adjust => 0.1
```

Stacking the different groups instead of overlaying them.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE bill_dep AS x, species AS colour FROM ggsql:penguins
  DRAW density SETTING stacking => 'on'
```

Using weighted estimates by mapping a column to the optional weight aesthetic. Note that the difference in output is subtle.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE bill_dep AS x, species AS colour FROM ggsql:penguins
  DRAW density 
    MAPPING body_mass AS weight
    SETTING opacity => 0.8
```
